### Abstract:
Decoding motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signals is fundamental to the development of brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) systems. However, robust decoding remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of MI-EEG signals. This study proposes the Temporal Convolutional Attention Network (TCANet), a novel end-to-end model that hierarchically captures spatiotemporal dependencies by progressively integrating local, fused, and global features. Specifically, TCANet employs a multi-scale convolutional module to extract local spatiotemporal representations across multiple temporal resolutions. A temporal convolutional module then fuses and compresses these multi-scale features while modeling both short- and long-term dependencies. Subsequently, a stacked multi-head self-attention mechanism refines the global representations, followed by a fully connected layer that performs MI-EEG classification. The proposed model was systematically evaluated on the BCI IV-2a and IV-2b datasets under both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. In subject-dependent classification, TCANet achieved accuracies of 83.06% and 88.52% on BCI IV-2a and IV-2b respectively, with corresponding Kappa values of 0.7742 and 0.7703, outperforming multiple representative baselines. In the more challenging subject-independent setting, TCANet achieved competitive performance on IV-2a and demonstrated potential for improvement on IV-2b.
